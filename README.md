## Background

When I first started developing for the Sega Genesis I noticed it was really tedious to create asset (tilesets, tilemaps etc..) files from scratch. This project is my aim to make that task much easier to get started with. I know applications like this already exist, but I wanted one that would work for me (and hopefully you).


## Description/Overview

This application allows you to create and edit various graphical asset files for use in Sega Genesis developement/homebrew.
Some assets you can create/edit include but are not limited to:
- Palettes (up to 4 for each project)
- Tiles (8x8 pixels)
- Tilesets
- Chunks (Group of tiles)
- Chunksets
- Tilemaps
